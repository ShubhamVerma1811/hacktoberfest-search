# Check it out here : [HacktoberFest Search](https://hacktoberfest-search.vercel.app)

This is a small project that I made for the event of HacktoberFest.

People who are new to it can head to this website and search open open source projects based on the labels and language.

I know the site doesn't look good, because I wanted to make it quickly for the community.
If you want you can fork this repo and contribute to this project.
